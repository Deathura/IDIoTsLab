#IDIoTsLab

*Welcome to the IDIoTsLab repository !*

We have ideas, we are not experts, we try things, we fail things, we never give up on our projects.
Above all that, we test & learn, we are idiotslab.

We will share with you here all our code, experiment, IDIocies... 

Have fun and always keep in mind : *"Don't be an expert, stay an IDIoTs !"* :poop: :nerd_face:
